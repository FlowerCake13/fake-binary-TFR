He's super awesome and super cool but there's one problem...

He talks in binary, so you need to translate the things the says!

## Your mission
Given a string that is a mix of words and numbers, create a function called **roboTranslator** that takes in a parameter *word* and replace anything in the string that is not a number with '1' and anything that is a number with '0'. 

Return the newly replaced string.

## Hint!
You will need to loop a for use loops!

## Check
 - roboTranslator("Hello"), must return "11111"
 - roboTranslator("10112H"), must return "000001"
 - roboTranslator("What 213812 i0 th0t"), must return "1111 000000 10 1101";
